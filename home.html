   <span class="top-span">When is it
    legal ?</span>
   <p><strong>Since the hemp farm act
     bill was passed in 2018 anything
     with thc under the legal 0.3%
     limit of dry weight thc, is legal
     in most states. In some cases its
     more of the countys choice, but
     everything we sell since in the
     carolinas it is still illegal to
     pocess or sell thc, we on the
     other hand sell it but its
     deprived from hemp and not
     deprived from thc. This is a big
     difference because it makes it
     legal and has 0.3% of canabanoids
     which are the plant itself that
     grows woth and from thc. </strong>

  <div id="mid-div">
   <span class="mid-span">What is
    kratom ?</span>
   <p><strong>Kratom is a native plant
     to south east asia, it gives
     similar affects to opioids and is
     used by more people than you
     think. some of the side effects
     are pain relief, energetic,
     talkative, alertness, and
     motion.It is not reccomended to
     take if you don't use or have had
     a history with opioids, as it can
     have health concerns such as
     nausea, dry mouth, increased heart
     rate etc... </strong></p>
  </div>
  <div id="bottom-div">
   <span class="bottom-span">How does
    THCA work ?</span>
   <p><strong> THCA is deprived from
     hemp instead of THC and is only
     missing 1 compound and is less
     potnent then THC but when heated
     the THCA is converted into a
     psychoactive quality which gives
     you the high feeling. In illegal
     states where you can't pocess or
     buy THC, the THCA is the closes
     you can get to similar and strong
     effects as THC deprived
     bud.</strong></p>
